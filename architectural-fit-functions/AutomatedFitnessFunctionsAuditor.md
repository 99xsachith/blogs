# A step by step guide for designing automated fitness functions auditor (AFFA)

## Step 1 : Identify and Prioritize Architectural Characteristics

Begin by determining the key architectural characteristics (architecturally significant quality attribute) crucial for your application's success. These could include,

1. Performance
1. Scalability
1. Security
1. Maintainability
1. Compliance
1. Extensibility
1. Agility
1. Availability


Get involve various stakeholders including,

1. Business representatives
1. Compliance officers
1. Operations personnel
1. Security experts
1. Infrastructure specialists
1. Application developers


Encourage stakeholders to list their top architectural priorities, then group these into common themes. This process highlights potential conflicts or trade-offs that need to be addressed.
For example, if agility and stability emerge as competing priorities, shifting the mindset to prioritize "mean time to recovery" (MTTR) over "mean time between failure" (MTBF) can help resolve the conflict.
Prioritize these characteristics based on stakeholder motivation and the overall impact on the business.


## Step 2 : Define Objective and Measurable Fitness Functions

### Generating testable matrices

**Performance:**
Response Time: Time taken to respond to a request.
Throughput: Number of transactions processed in a given time period.
Latency: Time delay between the request and the start of the response.
Resource Utilization: CPU, memory, disk, and network usage.

**Scalability:**
Load Testing Metrics: Performance under increased load.
Horizontal Scalability: Ability to add more instances.
Vertical Scalability: Ability to enhance existing instance capacity.
Elasticity: Ability to scale up/down quickly based on demand.

**Security:**
Vulnerability Density: Number of vulnerabilities per thousand lines of code (KLOC).
Incident Response Time: Time taken to detect and respond to security incidents.
Authentication/Authorization Metrics: Success and failure rates of authentication/authorization attempts.
Penetration Testing Results: Findings from security penetration tests.

**Maintainability:**
Code Complexity Metrics: Cyclomatic complexity, Halstead complexity measures.
Code Churn: Frequency of code changes.
Defect Density: Number of defects per KLOC.
Mean Time to Repair (MTTR): Average time to fix defects.

**Compliance:**
Audit Results: Results from compliance audits.
Regulatory Adherence: Percentage of compliance with regulatory requirements.
Policy Adherence: Percentage of adherence to internal policies and standards.
Documentation Completeness: Completeness and accuracy of documentation.

**Extensibility:**
Modularity: Degree to which components can be separated and recombined.
Extension Points: Number and quality of predefined extension points.
Change Impact Analysis: Effort required to implement new features.
Plugin/Add-on Integration: Ease of integrating plugins or add-ons.

**Agility:**
Release Frequency: How often new features and updates are released.
Cycle Time: Time from feature request to delivery.
Customer Feedback Loop: Time taken to gather and implement customer feedback.
Feature Turnaround Time: Time to develop and deploy new features.

**Availability:**
Uptime Percentage: Percentage of time the system is operational.
Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF): Average time between system failures.
Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR): Average time to recover from a failure.
Failure Rate: Frequency of system failures.


### Defining the criteria
Fitness functions should have clear pass/fail criteria or thresholds that can be objectively evaluated.
*Consider the context and dynamics of your system. For instance, performance thresholds might vary depending on the scale of operations.*

### Documenting the fitness functions
Document these fitness functions, according to the following format.

|Purpose|Metric|Criteria / Threshold|
|--|--|--|
|x|x|x|


This documentation serves as a valuable reference for developers and helps communicate architectural expectations.


## Step 3 : Select Tools and Technologies for Automation

Choose tools and frameworks that align with your technology stack and the specific characteristics you're testing.

Examples include:

1. Code quality: JDepend, ArchUnit, SonarQube
1. Resiliency: Chaos Monkey, Gremlin
1. Security: SAST tools, dependency vulnerability scanners
1. Performance: JMeter, Gatling, k6
1. Database: Flyway, Liquibase, DBDeploy


Leverage existing testing frameworks like JUnit or pytest to structure your fitness function tests.

Utilize infrastructure-as-code tools like Puppet, Chef, Docker, terraform or Vagrant to automate environment setup and tear-down for testing.

## Step 4 : Implement Automated Tests
Write automated tests that execute the chosen fitness functions and evaluate the results against the defined criteria.


### Different types of fitness function implementations:

**Triggered tests** can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines, providing immediate feedback on architectural violations.

**Continuous monitoring** can be implemented using tools like Nagios, Prometheus, or Grafana to track system behavior and alert on anomalies.

Ensure your tests cover the relevant aspects of the architectural characteristic being evaluated. For example, security tests should consider various attack vectors and potential vulnerabilities.


## Step 5 : Integrate with Development and Deployment Processes

1. Integrate triggered fitness function tests into your CI/CD pipelines to enforce architectural rules during development and deployment.

1. Configure continuous monitoring tools to alert on violations of predefined thresholds, enabling proactive identification and resolution of architectural issues.

1. Treat fitness function tests as first-class citizens in your codebase. Version control them, review them regularly, and refactor them as needed to ensure they remain effective and maintainable.


# Best Practices for Building Automated Fitness Functions:

## Enforcing Layering Rules: 
To prevent unauthorized access between architectural layers, write a test using ArchUnit that analyzes code dependencies and fails if a class in the presentation layer directly accesses the database layer.

## Ensuring RESTful API Compliance: 
Implement a test that checks every service endpoint for proper handling of all RESTful verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and fails if any endpoint exhibits incorrect behavior.

## Monitoring Response Times: 
Set up a monitoring tool like Prometheus to continuously track response times for critical transactions. Configure alerts to notify the team if response times exceed predefined thresholds, enabling prompt investigation and remediation.


## Checking for Stale Data: 
Write a triggered fitness function that queries the database for data freshness and fails if data exceeds the defined staleness limit. This ensures data integrity, especially in systems that rely heavily on caching.


# Key Benefits of Automating Fitness Functions:

## Proactive Architectural Governance: 
Automating fitness functions helps prevent architectural drift by continuously monitoring and enforcing architectural rules.

## Improved Code Quality: 
Automating code-level fitness functions ensures adherence to coding standards, best practices, and complexity limits, leading to more maintainable and robust code.

## Reduced Risk and Technical Debt: 
Early detection of architectural violations through automated testing helps mitigate risks and reduce the accumulation of technical debt.

## Enhanced Collaboration and Communication: 
Automating fitness functions serves as a shared language between developers and architects, fostering collaboration and aligning technical teams on architectural goals.

# Conclusion
By carefully designing and implementing automated fitness functions, you can create a more robust, maintainable, and adaptable software architecture that effectively supports your evolving business needs. Remember to continuously review and refine your fitness functions to ensure they remain relevant and aligned with your architectural goals.
