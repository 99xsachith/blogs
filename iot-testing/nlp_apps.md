## Implementation Examples

### Smart Surveillance System
```python
import cv2
import numpy as np
from transformers import AutoModelForImageClassification

class SmartSurveillance:
    def __init__(self):
        self.camera = cv2.VideoCapture(0)
        self.model = AutoModelForImageClassification.from_pretrained("small-model-name")
        self.fps = 15  # Achievable frame rate
        
    def process_stream(self):
        while True:
            ret, frame = self.camera.read()
            # Process frame for object detection
            # Can handle 1080p at 15-30 FPS
```

### Document Processing System
```python
from transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification
import torch

class DocumentProcessor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("distilbert-base-uncased")
        self.model.half()  # Use FP16 for better performance
        self.model.cuda()  # Use GPU
        
    def process_batch(self, documents, batch_size=16):
        # Can handle batches of documents efficiently
        # Process ~100-200 pages per minute depending on task
```

### Real-time Translation Service
```python
from transformers import AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM

class TranslationService:
    def __init__(self):
        # Use smaller translation models like Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-*
        self.model = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained("helsinki-nlp/opus-mt-en-fr")
        self.model.cuda()
        
    def translate(self, text):
        # Can handle real-time translation
        # Suitable for chat or subtitle translation
```

## Hardware Limitations

### Model Size Constraints
- Best with models under 4GB
- Larger models need quantization
- Full-size LLMs (like GPT-3) won't run efficiently

### Processing Capacity
- Best for single-task or limited multi-task scenarios
- Can handle real-time processing but with optimized models
- May need batch processing for heavy workloads

## Ideal Use Cases

### Small Business Applications
- Customer service chatbot
- Document processing system
- Quality control system
- Security surveillance

### Research Projects
- Data analysis
- Prototype development
- Small-scale experiments

### Edge Computing Solutions
- IoT device monitoring
- Local data processing
- Privacy-focused applications

## Not Recommended For
- Large language model hosting (e.g., full GPT-3/4)
- Multiple concurrent heavy AI tasks
- High-volume video processing (3+ streams)
- Complex 3D rendering tasks

## Best Practices
1. Use model optimization techniques (quantization, pruning)
2. Implement batch processing when possible
3. Monitor memory usage and GPU utilization
4. Use TensorRT for optimization
5. Cache frequent operations

## Getting Started
1. Install required dependencies
2. Choose appropriate model size
3. Implement optimization techniques
4. Test with sample data
5. Monitor performance metrics
6. Scale gradually
